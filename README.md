# HIT OR MISS
# Our robot will hit an incoming object with a bat or 
# catch the object with a loop depending on the implementation of the project.
# The (vision) sensors placed on the ground will be used to estimate the trajectory of the object in the 3D space. 
# The robot will use the prediction to either hit or catch the object with accuracy.
