# MAZE SOLVE 
# Our P3DX ROBOT  will solve a maze environment using the BFS Algorithm.
# 
# Sense Walls:
# It will read values from the ultrasonic sensors to find the distance to the detected object. If the distance is less than 0.2, it has sensed a wall. 
# Current Implementation: 
# Robot immediately stops after detection of robot
# Future Implementation:
# Robot should return one step to its previous location and return to search.
